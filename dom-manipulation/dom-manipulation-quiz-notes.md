- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
  using the text content operator followed by the rules that are set for example incrementing
- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
  yes, because it allows us to see when the event is first initialized

  more complicated since setting the variable to 0 and manipulating it to increment lets us visually see that it is working in the console log and the live reload server

  because we are allowed to manipulate variables, where as the DOM is already set and is just being searched for in the first activation
