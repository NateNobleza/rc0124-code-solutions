Your Career
How do you advance your career? When will you next get promoted? What do you do if you didn't get promoted but thought you should? When do you look for new work?

These questions are the focus of this presentation.

Your Career and You
Many people believe that it is their manager's job to make sure they are advancing in their career. This is not a good strategy for success — you are responsible for your own career!

Career Path
Typical career progression: junior, midlevel, senior, staff. (Note that level names vary from company to company. These are the names I'll use in this presentation.)

At the "senior" and "staff" levels, engineers often start moving into either technical leadership or management (or both if the company offers it).

What distinguishes each level?

junior: given detailed tasks but expected to be self-directed
midlevel: given features; breaks them down into tasks and executes them
senior: given projects; breaks them down into features and modules, and executes them; often with a team or leading a small team
staff: given problems to solve; figures out what systems, architecture, or features will address them; usually engaging one or more teams
Time at Level
People often ask how quickly they should be promoted to the next level. This, of course, varies depending on experience and skills, and on the company and on opportunities within the company.

Typically, promotions follow a timeline similar to:

junior: promoted to midlevel after 2-3 years
midlevel: promoted to senior after additional 3-5 years
senior: promoted to staff after additional 5-10 years
Note that the more senior you get the harder it is to get promoted and the longer it takes.

Advancing Your Career
You are responsible for your own career, but what can you do to advance in your career?

Remember that your manager and company's HR are not driving your career, but they are there to help. Use them!

What will most affect your career?

Note that in most companies, the opinion of your peers can have a large impact on your career. Foster a good reputation among your peers of being a hard worker, getting things done, asking good questions, and being kind and helpful.

Your career will be most influenced by your reputation for delivering — delivering quality code, on time. When I was at Google I was starting a project. I kept seeing documents about competing ideas and projects within the company. I kept asking my director about these until one day he said, "Robert, Google has numerous sharp engineers with big ideas who can write great documents. But what we need is people who can deliver. So stop worrying about everyone else and just deliver." I did that, the project was successful, and this has now become my mantra: "Just deliver!"

Some things you can do to help your career:

Under-promise and over-deliver
(but promise enough to maintain a good reputation)
Continually make progress on your assignments
Get to know your peers and co-workers, both on your team and outside your team; forge a good relationship with them
Both ask for help from your peers and offer help
Meet regularly one-on-one with your manager (at least once per month, preferably more often)
In meetings with manager:
Report on your assignment and get suggestions on how to proceed past any blockages.
Ask for an assessment of how you are doing.
Discuss the next steps in your career.
Ask for advice on how to take the next step.
Learn about company career advancement practices.
When to Leave Your Company
Sometimes you start feeling it's time to leave your company for greener pastures. For example, you feel you were passed over for promotion, or the work environment feels stressful, or a recruiter starts talking to you about other opportunities. Here is some advice on picking a good company and deciding when it's time to leave.

Look for an environment where you can learn. Try to be surrounded by high quality peers who can teach you and who value mentoring others. As your skills grow, be one of those "high quality peers"!
Prefer a company that has high expectations of the code it creates and uses. Sloppy code usually means lots of bugs and leadership that values showing off rather than producing a quality product.
Prefer a company that emphasizes providing value to its customers. Working at such a company will likely be rewarding.
Getting along with your co-workers is important. However, you don't need to "like" them, you just need to be able to work together successfully.
If things aren't going well for you, first examine yourself and decide if you are the problem and if there are things you can do to improve.
If things still aren't going well for you, look for other opportunities within the company. It's much less stressful to move within the company than to move to another company.
Keep your LinkedIn profile up to date and willing to accept messages from recruiters. You may not be looking for a new job, but it's good to know what's available, and one may come along that is "too good to pass up."
It is much easier to find a new job when you are already employed. If you resign abruptly and then start looking, potential employers will likely ask what happened. It is hard to provide an answer that will satisfy.
If you look for work elsewhere, have a good story for why you are willing to leave. Employers don't want to hire people who are likely to leave soon for seemingly arbitrary reasons. They want to hire people who will be dedicated and productive. Be one of those people, and show potential employers that you are one of those people.
